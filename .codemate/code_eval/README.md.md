## [`package.json`]
### Scripts Section
Make sure that all necessary scripts are clearly defined in `package.json` to maintain consistency across environments.

- **Suggested Change**:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview",
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix"
},
```

## [`tsconfig.json`]
### Strict Type-Checking
Using TypeScript's strict mode ensures better type safety and code reliability.

- **Suggested Change:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    // other options...
  }
}
```

## [`public/index.html`]
### Meta Tags for SEO
Adding meta tags improves the SEO and accessibility of the application.

- **Suggested Change:**
```html
<head>
  <!-- Other tags -->
  <meta name="description" content="LeadWise AI Resume Builder: Empowering job seekers by providing modern, effective tools to create professional resumes.">
  <meta name="keywords" content="resume builder, AI, job search, templates, career">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
```

## [`src/components/ResumeBuilder.tsx`]
### Optimized Rendering
Ensure that unnecessary re-renders are minimized through the use of `React.memo` for functional components.

- **Current Implementation:**
```typescript
const ResumeBuilder = () => {
  // Component code
}
```

- **Suggested Change:**
```typescript
const ResumeBuilder = React.memo(() => {
  // Component code
});
```

### Error Handling
Add error boundaries in the main component file to gracefully handle rendering errors.

- **Suggested Change:**
```typescript
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // Log the error to an error reporting service
    console.log(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}

// Usage in main render
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ResumeBuilder />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
