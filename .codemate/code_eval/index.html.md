# Code Review Report

The provided code is a basic HTML template for a web application. Below are the critical issues, suggestions for optimization, and industry-standard recommendations along with the corrected code lines in pseudocode.

## Critical Review and Issues

1. **Character Set Declaration**: `<meta charset="UTF-8" />` should be `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
2. **Favicon Type**: Using JPEG for a favicon is unconventional and may not render correctly across all browsers. Prefer using PNG or ICO format.
3. **HTML5 Doctype**: Ensure correct declaration.
4. **Viewport Meta Tag**: Ensure responsiveness and appropriate scaling.
5. **JavaScript Module Loading**: The script type declaration must be consistent with the project's standards.

## Suggested Corrections

### Character Set Declaration

```pseudo
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

### Favicon Type

Replace the favicon with a PNG or ICO file which is a more standard format for favicons.

```pseudo
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/logo.png" />
```

### HTML5 Doctype

Ensure proper HTML5 doctype declaration.

```pseudo
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### Viewport Meta Tag

Update the viewport settings to enhance mobile responsiveness.

```pseudo
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
```

### JavaScript Module Loading

Ensure the script type declaration aligns with project standards and browser compatibility.

```pseudo
<script src="/src/main.tsx" type="module"></script>
```

## Updated HTML Snippet

The corrected parts of the HTML template in pseudocode:

```pseudo
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/logo.png" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
    <meta name="description" content="Craft your future with LeadWise's AI-powered resume builder. Get matched with top jobs and land your dream role." />
    <title>LeadWise Resume Builder</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/src/main.tsx" type="module"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This ensures the code adheres to modern web development standards, enhancing compatibility and performance across different browsers and devices.
