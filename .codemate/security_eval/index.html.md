# Security Vulnerabilities Report

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities found in the given HTML code. Each vulnerability is described along with recommended measures for mitigation.

## 1. Lack of Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Description
The code does not include a Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is a security feature that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources are allowed to load content on your web page.

### Recommendation
Add a `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag to define allowed sources. Example:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';">
```

## 2. Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI)

### Description
Subresource Integrity (SRI) allows you to ensure that the files you are including (such as scripts) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. The code does not include SRI for the script tag.

### Recommendation
Include an `integrity` attribute in the script tag with the SRI hash. Example:
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx" integrity="sha384-xxxxxx" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
(Note: Replace `xxxxxx` with the actual SRI hash.)

## 3. Lack of HTTP Security Headers

### Description
The code does not specify various HTTP security headers that can help protect against common attacks such as clickjacking, cross-site scripting, and other code injection attacks.

### Recommendation
Implement the following HTTP security headers:
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)** to ensure the application is accessed over HTTPS.
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME-sniffing.
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent clickjacking.
- **X-XSS-Protection** to enable Cross-Site Scripting filtering.

Example:
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
<script>
  fetch('/set-headers', {
    headers: {
      'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
      'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
      'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
      'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'
    }
  });
</script>
```

## 4. No Use of HTTPS Links

### Description
The script source link does not enforce the use of HTTPS, which could open the application to man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Recommendation
Ensure all external resources are loaded over HTTPS. Example:
```html
<script type="module" src="https://your-secure-url.com/src/main.tsx"></script>
```

## 5. No Input Validation or Sanitization

### Description
There is no input validation or sanitization being performed. This typically would be an issue within the script but noting this here due to the inclusion of a root div which likely will handle user input in the JavaScript.

### Recommendation
Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized properly on both client and server sides. Utilize libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML.
