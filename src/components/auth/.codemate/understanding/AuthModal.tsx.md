### High-Level Documentation

#### Purpose:
The `AuthModal` component is a user authentication modal designed for a React application. It provides functionalities for both user sign-in and sign-up through a tabbed interface, leveraging the `supabase` backend for authentication.

#### Key Components:

1. **State Management:**
   - `useState` hooks are used to manage the modal's active tab, loading state, password visibility, form data, and error messages.

2. **UI Components:**
   - Reusable UI components such as `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Dialog`, `Tabs`, and `Card` are imported to build a consistent and interactive user interface.
   - Icons from `lucide-react` are used to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

3. **Tabs:**
   - The modal features two tabs: "Sign In" and "Sign Up".
   - The tabs contain forms with input fields for email, password, and other necessary information.
   - Password visibility toggle feature is provided.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Error messages are displayed in a styled alert box if any issue occurs during authentication.
   - Password validation is enforced during sign-up.

5. **Animations:**
   - `framer-motion` is utilized to animate tab transitions for a smooth user experience.

6. **Responsive Dialog:**
   - The modal uses `Dialog` from the custom `ui` components to ensure it is responsive and user-friendly.

7. **Authentication Logic:**
   - The `useAuth` hook provides `signIn` and `signUp` methods.
   - These methods are memoized to improve performance.
   - `handleSubmit` function manages the form submission process for both sign-in and sign-up, handling async operations and setting appropriate states based on the response.

8. **Props:**
   - `isOpen`: Controls the visibility of the modal.
   - `onClose`: A callback function to handle modal closure.
   - `onSuccess`: An optional callback function to handle successful user authentication.
   - `defaultTab`: Specifies which tab to display by default ("signin" or "signup").

#### Usage:
The `AuthModal` component can be integrated into any React application that requires user authentication. It provides a streamlined and animated interface for users to sign in or create a new account, with appropriate error handling and state management.
