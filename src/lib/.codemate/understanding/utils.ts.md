# Code Documentation

## Purpose
The code defines a utility function `cn` which helps in managing and merging CSS class names dynamically. It leverages two libraries - `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` to achieve this.

## Libraries Used
1. **clsx**: A utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally.
2. **tailwind-merge**: A utility specifically for handling and merging Tailwind CSS class names, ensuring no conflicts and resolving class names properly.

## Function: `cn`
- **Parameters**: 
  - Accepts a variable number of arguments (`...inputs`), each of which can be any value that `clsx` accepts.
- **Functionality**:
  - It first uses `clsx` to handle conditional class names and generate a single string of class names.
  - Then it passes this string to `twMerge` to resolve and merge Tailwind CSS class names appropriately.
- **Returns**: 
  - A single string of merged class names that is optimized and conflict-free, suitable for use in className attributes in a React component or similar.

## Usage Example
```js
const className = cn('btn', isActive && 'btn-active', 'px-4', 'px-2'); 
// This would resolve the class names considering Tailwind's conflicting classes
```

This utility function is especially useful in projects using Tailwind CSS where class name conflicts can frequently occur and need resolution.
