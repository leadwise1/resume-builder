### High-Level Documentation of the Code

The provided code is a configuration script for Tailwind CSS, which includes custom theme settings, particularly focused on design tokens for colors, typography, and UI components. It utilizes a combination of CSS variables and Tailwind's utility classes.

#### Key Features:

1. **Tailwind Base Configuration:**
   - The script imports the base styles, components, and utilities from Tailwind CSS using `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` directives.

2. **CSS Custom Properties:**
   - The `:root` selector defines global CSS variables (custom properties) that store color values, font sizes, font weights, border radiuses, etc., to ensure consistency across the UI.
   - The colors are defined using both HEX values and the OKLCH color model, which provides more perceptually uniform color handling.

3. **Dark Mode Configuration:**
   - Inside the `.dark` selector, overrides are specified for dark mode, modifying the color variables to suitable dark theme values ensuring good contrast and readability.

4. **Global Application Styles Using `@layer base`:**
   - A second `@layer base` block applies default Tailwind CSS utility classes globally.
   - All elements (`*`) are given a default border color using `border-border`.
   - The `body` element is styled with background and text colors based on the variables defined earlier (`bg-background` and `text-foreground`).

5. **Responsive Root Font Size:**
   - The `html` element sets the root font-size to the value defined by the `--font-size` variable, allowing easy scaling and responsive typography throughout the application.

#### Custom Variables Description:

- **Colors:** Variables like `--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--secondary`, etc., define the color scheme for different components and states in both light and dark modes.
- **Typography:** Variables like `--font-size` and `--font-weight-*` control the baseline font size and font weights (normal and medium).
- **UI Components:** Properties like `--card`, `--popover`, `--border`, `--input-background` set styles for specific UI components such as cards, popovers, and input fields.
- **Dark Mode Specifics:** The `.dark` class changes the color scheme to dark mode by redefining the same set of variables.

This configuration ensures a consistent, easily maintainable styling system that can switch between light and dark modes seamlessly while leveraging Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach.
